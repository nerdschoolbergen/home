        <p>Nerdschool is a series of workshop exercises teaching tools and techniques commonly used in real software development.
            If you are a budding programmer still at school, or just interested in learning some basic programming skills
            used by developers in real projects, join us! Nerdschool is run by professional developers and we are all looking
            forwards to seeing you!</p>

<a id="when-what" class="anchor" href="#when-what" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When is it and what will I learn?</h3>

        <p>We aim for 10 workshops over a year, 5 for each school semester. The subjects are discussed by the organizers before
            every semester to ensure the workshops are kept relevant and interesting. Some will be kept and repeated the
            next year, and some will be changed. Examples of subjects are JavaScript, Git, Bash/shell scripting, test driven
            development, clean code, SOLID, build & deploy (continuous deployment), and more. The goal is to fill the gap
            between what is learned in school and what you'll need when programming is your job.</p>

        <p>Workshops are held on tuesdays every 2 weeks. It starts at 17:00 and ends at 20:30.</p>
        <h3>
<a id="how-where" class="anchor" href="#how-where" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How and where?</h3>

        <p>All our events are organized through <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup</a>, so please sign up and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bergen-Nerdschool/"
            target="_blank">join us there</a>. We are located in Bergen, Norway. All sessions are held at Høyteknologisenteret,
            part of UiB. We start usually start 17:00, and if you don't have access to the building, there will be a number
            on the door with a number you can call and we'll open for you. You don't have to be a student to participate.</p>

<a id="organizers" class="anchor" href="#organizers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are the organizers?</h3>

        <p>All organizers are professional software developers with a passion and deep knowledge of the craft. We want everyone
            to be as enthustiastic about programming as we are, and we know that there is a steep and daunting learning curve
            when starting out. That's why we want to show you what we wish we had learned between school and starting our
            careers.
